# 🧪 BlueJ Projects ✨

This project is a collection of programming exercises based on the book
📘 [*Objects First with Java: A Practical Introduction Using BlueJ*](https://www.bluej.org/objects-first/).

I created these exercises for personal joy 🎈 — to rediscover and refresh programming concepts 🧠 in a safe, playful space 🎮.

## 🧰 Scripts

You can access project scripts with `source dev-tool.sh` 🪄

🌟 Example usage:

```bash
source-dev-tool.sh
# Lists modules in this project
$ `list`
# Selects 01-shape module in the nexts commands (supports autocomplete)
$ `choose 01-shapes`
# Runs a build on 01-shapes module
$ `build`
# Starts 01-shapes module with args = "demo circle"
$ `start demo circle`
# Exit dev-tool.sh
$ `exit`
# Back to usual console
```

Happy coding! ✨🐢🧑‍💻
